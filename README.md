# TamD_Crawler
In two words, this code is getting the general information (site's url, title, text, date, image's url) from the site (as an ex.: "zakon.kz").
main1 starts the functions which are included in "crawler1".
To see the result you should open the local site on port 8080 and add to the url "/short_news" or "/full_news" as a result will be "http://localhost:8080/full_news". Optionally here can be mentioned counter to get needed number of news, so it looks like "http://localhost:8080/full_news?count=2" or "http://localhost:8080/short_news?count=3".
